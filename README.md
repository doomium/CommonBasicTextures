CommonBasicTextures
===================

A bunch of basic shaped textures with clear reference names. Transparency color is pure Magenta (255, 0, 255) for textures in which it is relevant. This will be updated as I decide to update it and it is probably not very efficent to reference the textures indiviually, but it is good for fast prototyping.
